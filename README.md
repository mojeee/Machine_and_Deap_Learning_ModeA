Abstract
-------------------------


Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. Take this example:

For each record, it is provided:

Files
-------------------------
The dataset includes the following files:

Files  | Description
------------- | -------------
'README.txt'  | 
'main.py'  | Almost all the essential function for post-processing is provided in each section. Also, there is enough comment for each section.
'.png or .jpg in nlp-getting-started folder'  | Images are used for wordcloud, absolutely not all of them
'predict.csv'  | The output of prediction for test data
'test.csv'  | Test Data
'sample_submission.csv'  | Sample of submission file in the kaggle
'train.csv'  | Train data 




Notes
--------------------------
* A new user should read 'comments' carefully.
